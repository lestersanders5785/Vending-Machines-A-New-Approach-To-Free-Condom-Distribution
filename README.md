# Vending-Machines-A-New-Approach-To-Free-Condom-Distribution
The distribution of condoms is a structural intervention that is both affordable and successful in giving communities the tools they need to stop the spread of HIV. Effective HIV prevention relies on condom distribution initiatives that make them broadly accessible.<br>
The eC-Card is a free condom application that helps providers provide services and dispense free contraception to users in their area. The SaaS-based free condom application helps healthcare providers and sexual clinics to:<br>
•	provide free condoms to teens in their area<br>
•	easily collect data on the sexual health of teens<br>
•	track STI outbreaks<br>
•	customize your services as per your unique user base<br>
•	upload education materials and services related to sexual health<br>
•	distribute condoms with zero interaction<br>

The eC-Card application was built using SaaS technology, giving it an edge over its competitors due to its being customizable, flexible, cost-effective, and easily accessible. <br>

However, it had one drawback- the user had to stay near pharmacies, sexual health clinics, or healthcare providers to access free contraception. This limited the areas where the application could be used, as the current system needs a network of pharmacies to dispense condoms. For this, the idea of installing condom vending machines emerged. <br>

By putting together the accessibility of SaaS-based applications with the convenience of vending machines, these condom dispensing machines that can be installed anywhere for easy access to condoms evolved. <br>

These smart vending machines can be placed at locations where no pharmacists are present, but there are many young people. For example, the vending machine can be placed outside nightclubs, so it is very accessible for people and provides them with complete privacy when getting free contraception- something that many young people are concerned with. <br>

The working of this is quite simple. The user has to register on the condom distribution application through the SaaS-based web app, answer a few queries, and they will be guided to the nearest collection point. Once there, they can collect condoms by just scanning a QR code at the vending machine. <br>

Benefits Of Using eC-Card Vending Machines <br>

This standalone technology will help service providers by letting them provide condoms to a larger area. So apart from offering your services through the application alone, you can now use vending machines to dispense condoms in areas of your selection where users do not have immediate access to pharmacies. <br>

Low Maintenance: Partnering with eC-Card condom dispensing machines will help with seamless maintenance and installation. Find the best placements for your business and ensure that your machine is always stocked with free contraception. Since the free condom application is based on SaaS technology, ongoing costs like maintenance and upgrades are no longer a factor, as SaaS applications are easily downloadable and maintenance-free. <br>

Accessibility and Convenience: The free condom application can be accessed from anywhere worldwide as it is SaaS-based. All one needs is a stable internet connection and a browser. Thus, the service provider can distribute condoms to any user base in the country. You can further increase your user base with smart condom vending machines. These vending machines offer fast services and ensure that young people have easy access to free contraception at prime locations. <br>

Promotes Sexual Health: By providing easy access to condoms through our condom card application and vending machines, service providers can complete their aim of promoting sexual health and wellness among young people. <br>

Saves Money: Using condom distribution applications through vending machines helps save costs in two ways. One: it works through a pay-as-you-use pricing model that allows service providers to reduce costs. Second, setting up a pharmacy to dispense free contraception is not feasible. However, vending machines have no operating expenses, you don't require third-party vendors, and you don't have to bother about monthly salaries and payrolls. <br>

How To Get Started?<br>

Instead of having to learn about sex on their own or from questionable sources, teens will be able to learn about it from specialists thanks to the eC-Card condom distribution application. Additionally, sexual healthcare professionals may impart knowledge on STIs, safe sexual practices, and other topics.<br>

The eC-Card condom vending machines are the finest option for providing sexual healthcare services that will make it simple for teens to get condoms. This is the best way to combat ignorance and the absence of free contraception.<br>
